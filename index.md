## Me

This is what I look like:

![picture of me](other_images/me3.png)

I am a fourth year student at UCSD, majoring in Math-Computer Science. I have been interested in both math and computer science from a young age. Among my earliest programs, from age 11, is a Visual Basic script file that takes two numbers and an operator and outputs the result:
```
DO
op=inputbox("operator")
if op = "quit" then Exit Do
n1=inputbox("number 1")
n2=inputbox("number 2")
if op = "+" then msgbox n1-n2*-1
if op = "-" then msgbox n1-n2
if op = "/" then msgbox n1/n2
if op = "*" then msgbox n1*n2
Loop
```
(I don't remember why it uses `n1-n2*-1` to add the numbers.)

This is a batch of [koshari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Koshary) that I made recently. It was quite good.

This is my most recent attempt at [omu-rice](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omurice). It's not perfect, but it's getting there.
